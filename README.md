## Dataset
1. It is important to understand what data needs to be used for modelling.
2. We rely on prior work, [TADPOLE Challange](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/)challenge to decide on what CSV files and what features from each CSV file to be used for modelling.
3. We also plan to extend the above work by using previously unused features for modelling.

# TODOs
1. Add model code.
2. Add experiment logging.
